Running the program will only change you the ui for the rightclick on file explorer and desktop.

This was made mainly to get rid of the tedious show more options button and display everything nicely like it did in windows 10 context menu.

I also included another program to revert the changes incase you wish to go back to the windows 11 ui.

Requires PC Restart to apply changes.
